# LDT-SORT
Project Overviewüìù 
===
`LDT-SORT` is a multi-object tracking framework that combines the `FlexDet` detector with confidence state tracking, designed to address challenges such as dense crowds, occlusion, and target similarity. It enhances the accuracy and efficiency of pedestrian multi-object tracking by integrating state-of-the-art convolutional models and similarity metrics.The code for `LDT-SORT` will be made publicly available once our paper is accepted.<br>
